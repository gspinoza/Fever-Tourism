## Development

How to start:
- cd into "client" folder and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- cd into "server" folder and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- while inside the "server" folder run `npm run dev` to start both the frontend & backend servers



If you only want to work on the frontend:
- After installing all dependencies cd into "client" folder and run `npm start` to start development

If you only want to work on the backend:
- After installing all dependencies cd into "server" folder and run `npm run server` to start development

**Note:**
The client is configured to run on port 3000 and the server runs on port 4000
